  <tr>
    <td>
I learnt quite a lot, for example I learnt about how strings worked and I learnt many new things about booleans. I found it effective to simply plod through my work and make sure that I was going at my own pace and not trying to race others or race ahead for whatever reason.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
My learning was limited by the fact that I feel a compulsive need to help others when they ask for it and I feel as if I have to do it. I need to work on trying harder to follow the instructions to the letter and not just assume that something will work, even if it does work out.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
I will make sure not to help people every time they can't be bothered to work out a simple instruction, which should greatly improve my efficiency and how well I work in general.</td>
